## What is Aerocene?

From [aerocene.org](https://aerocene.org):
Aerocene is a multi-disciplinary project that foregrounds the artistic and scientific exploration of environmental issues. 
In the wake of the Anthropocene, the project promotes common links between social, mental, and environmental ecologies. 
Inflated only by air, lifted only by the sun, carried only by the wind, towards a sustainable future.

Aerocene is a transdisciplinary artistic project, an invitation to shape a period of time, a new epoch. Aerocene, developed by Aerocene Foundation, manifests as a series of air-fuelled sculptures that will achieve the longest, emission-free journey around the world: becoming buoyant only by the heat of the Sun and infrared radiation from the surface of Earth. The sculpture floats without burning fossil fuels, without using solar panels and batteries; and without helium, hydrogen and other rare gases. Aerocene holds a message of simplicity, creativity and cooperation for a world of tumultuous geopolitical relations, reminding us of our symbiotic relationship with the Earth and all its species.
